BACKEND CODE CHALLENGE

Build a simple service to allow two users to remotely play Noughts & Crosses.

Feel free to write it in a language of your choice. Our stack is Go based, so this could be a perfect opportunity to learn some Go if you haven’t already.

A user, either X or O, should be able to make a move, see the current state of the game and find out the winner via an API. The design of this simple API is up to you. No authentication is necessary.

Ideally write it as you would write production code. Don’t spend too long on this, it doesn’t have to be perfect! No more than a couple of hours. Please include a README describing what you’ve done and why, and how to run and use the service.

Send us a link to your git repo when you’re finished!
